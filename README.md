# üß† Cyberbullying Tweet Analysis

This project analyzes tweets to detect and classify instances of **cyberbullying** using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Cyberbullying Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashiqnazir/cbtweets), which contains labeled tweets across multiple bullying categories.
